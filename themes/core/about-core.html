<p class="p4"><b>ABOUT THE CORE FOLDER</b></p>
<p class="p5"><b>Last Updated: April 28th 2009</b></p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p5">Inside the Core folder are all the required files for WPtouch to work respectfully of the admin options and controls. Without these files WPtouch will not work.</p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p5">You can replace them with your own modified versions in your own theme folder, if you choose. Make sure you let users know which WPtouch functions and capabilities have been removed if you do override the core files.</p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p6">-How CoreTheme Works-</p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p5">The WPtouch CoreTheme is based on the combination of a Theme folder (in this case, the default one) and the Core folder.</p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p5">The Core folder contains only files automatically imported into the active theme, and contains all the features and capabilities of WPtouch separated from editable theme structure &amp; content.</p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p5">A Theme folder contains all the modifiable elements of a theme, without breaking the Core features and functions. It also contains information required to be shown and selected in the WordPress Wptouch admin panel. This information is read from the theme's readme.txt file. A theme folder can also contain a screenshot.png image to be shown in WordPress Wptouch admin panel, helping users choose and select a preferred theme easily.</p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p5">Together, the Core and the Theme folders make up a theme.</p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p6">-Creating a Custom Core-</p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p5">Just because Wptouch ships with a ready-made Core doesn't mean you can't make your own.</p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p5">To customize the Core files, simply copy a file or files from the Core folder into your Theme folder, and start editing.</p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p5">Wptouch always looks for the core files in your Theme folder first, and if it doesn't find it, defaults to the Core folder and uses it's files instead.</p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p5">This way you can still use some Core elements and functions, while modifying others.</p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p5">There's no limit here- you can customize an entire Core for yourself, keeping in mind that functions that are missing in your Core that exist in WPtouch's Core will cause the corresponding admin options to become neutered.</p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p6">-Minimum Theme Requirements, Creating Your Own Theme-</p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p5">A Custom WPtouch Theme must have the following files in order to work:</p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p5">- header.php</p>
<p class="p5">- index.php</p>
<p class="p5">- footer.php</p>
<p class="p5">- readme.txt</p>
<p class="p5">- screenshot.png</p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p5">You can create a new theme by simply copying the 'default' theme and re-naming it, then begin modifying it.</p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p5">We've also included a 'skeleton' theme which is stripped down and contains very little customization, just the minimum + the dependencies on CoreTheme so you can build it up however you like.</p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p6">What Does The WPtouch Core Include?</p>
<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p5">The WPtouch Core includes all the functions and features shown in the WordPress WPtouch admin panel. This allows us to add new features to the Core, and have them available to all custom themes (which are using the WPtouch Core) simultaneously. We'll also provide a documentation change-log for every change we make to the Core, so you can easily add them to your Core, or add custom styling to make the new feature look as you'd like in your Theme.</p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p5">CoreTheme also automatically loads:</p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p5">- jQuery (right out of WordPress!)</p>
<p class="p5">- Custom javascript which we've written for WPtouch</p>
<p class="p5">- functions.php file with our custom WPtouch functions (we'll add to this as needed for new features)</p>
<p class="p5">- POT file for language translations (you'll need to create your own for your custom Theme)</p>
