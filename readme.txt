== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I thought the iPhone/iPod touch shows my website fine the way it is now? =

Yes, that’s true for the most part (minus flash support). However, first of all not all blogs are created equal, and some sites don’t translate well in the viewport of the phone. Secondly, many WordPress sites today make heavy use of different javascripts which significantly increase the load time of pages, and drives users on EDGE batty. So we’ve come up with WPtouch, a slim, feature-rich, highly-customized ‘theme application’ of which includes an admin interface to let you customize page icons and your logo.

= Well, what if my users don’t like it and want to see my regular site? =

There’s an option in the footer on WPtouch for your users to easily switch between the WPtouch view and your site’s regular appearance. It’s that easy. You put a little snippet of code into your current theme which will be shown only to iPhone/iPod touch users and give them the ability to switch between the two easily, but we’ll get into that later in the instructions.

= Will it slow down my blog? =

Not bloody likely! Unless of course you’re getting slammed with all sorts of traffic because you’ve installed this sexy thang. The entire package for WPtouch is only 290kb. It was designed to be as lightweight and speedy as possible, while still serving your blog’s content in a richly presented way.
